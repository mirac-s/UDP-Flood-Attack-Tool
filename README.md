UDP Flood Tool (For Educational and Testing Purposes Only)

This Python script demonstrates how to perform a UDP flood attack by sending large amounts of UDP packets to a specified target IP address and port. The script utilizes multiprocessing to maximize packet throughput based on your CPU core count.
